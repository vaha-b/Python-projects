Welcome to my "Python Projects" where I try to become a Python Developer by building projects at hyperskill.org.


My projects are ordered from easy to nightmare(very hard).
In every project, you will find project description(.txt) and project implementation(.py) and in those files you will find links where you can read what each project is about and which topics it contains.
I recommed that you check the links since they contain more deteailed description about the projects and its topics.

I hope that you will enjoy in exploring my code and what I did.     

Have a nice day! :D â™¡

"PYTHON PROJECTS" IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT - SO EVERYTHING IS PRONE TO CHANGES
