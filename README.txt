Welcome to my "Python Projects" where I learn Python by building projects at hyperskill.org.


My projects are ordered from easy to nightmare(very hard). In every project, you will find project description(.txt) and project implementation(.py). And in those files you will find links where you can read what each project is about and which topics is covering. I recommed you to check them out.

I hope that you will enjoy in exploring my code and what I did.     

Have a nice day! :D â™¡
